# random-forest-land-classification
This project analyzes images from the summer of 2016 and 2019 using satellite imagery from NASA's Landsat 8. It uses random forest algorithms to study the spectral profile of the land and classify it as water, urban, rural and burned area and create a map of the classified area to determine how much of it was burned and how the land is recovering.
